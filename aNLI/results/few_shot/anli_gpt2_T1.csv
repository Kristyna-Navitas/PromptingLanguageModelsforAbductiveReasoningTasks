Summary of the Problem and Explanation of the Solution

You have 4 context choices. 2 hypotheses.

Here are the 4 hypotheses.

1: B = A

2: B = A

3: A = A

4:"
7e8df602-b632-4595-967c-fe982b643f3b-1,"
Hypothesis B. relates to the context because it is about a child wanting a change of environment. It explains why an eight year old would want to escape their home because nothing has changed in eight years.

The correct hypothesis is B.

Context: Everyone had been playing cards all day.
