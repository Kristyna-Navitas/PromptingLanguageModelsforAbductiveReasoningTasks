On the first problem, we make up a new hypothesis, which is: ""B. The boys foundapons"". And, of course, we have the context. On the second problem, we're given the same context, except that is has been written out"

The hypothesis choices in the abductive reasoning task are the single most powerful reason to choose the more likely explanation. And also the most vulnerable to being wrong. Because if the hypothesis is wrong, then the entire hypothesis is wrong, and there's a big hole on the"
